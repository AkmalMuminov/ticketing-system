# Ticketing System
A web-based ticketing system for collaboratively organizing and tracking issues. 

## Description
This is a basic web-based (HTML/CSS) issue tracking system developed primarily in Python and SQL, also leveraging JavaScript and PHP. The functionality of this collaborative system includes maintaining a list of outstanding items ("tickets") that can be generated and added to the tracking system until the status of a particular incident is closed or resolved. In addition to tickets, the system also maintains a database of users where only authenticated administrative users can view/edit/update incidents.
